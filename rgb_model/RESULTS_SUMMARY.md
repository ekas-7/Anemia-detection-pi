## 🎯 Learned Thresholds

The model learned optimal thresholds from training data:

| Feature            | Threshold | Normal Avg | Anemia Avg |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Red Intensity**  | 0.35      | 0.36       | 0.33       |
| **Paleness Score** | 0.90      | 0.90       | 0.90       |
| **Redness Ratio**  | 1.32      | 1.31       | 1.33       |

**Key Insight**: The differences between Normal and Anemia are subtle in this dataset, which explains the moderate accuracy. This suggests:

1. The dataset may have random labels (from our earlier processing)
2. RGB intensity alone may not be sufficient - need better quality labeled data
3. Additional features may be needed for higher accuracy

## 🧪 Batch Testing Results

Tested on **862 images** from the dataset:

| Prediction | Count | Percentage |
| ---------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Normal     | 543   | 63.0%      |
| Anemia     | 319   | 37.0%      |

**Average Confidence**: 79.89%

## 📋 RGB Intensity Features Analyzed

1. **Red Channel Intensity** (Mean, Median, Std, Min, Max)
2. **Green Channel Intensity** (Mean, Median)
3. **Blue Channel Intensity** (Mean, Median)
4. **Redness Ratio** (R/G) - Lower in anemia
5. **Red-Blue Ratio** (R/B)
6. **Paleness Score** (Brightness/Red) - Higher in anemia
7. **Overall Brightness**
8. **Red Intensity Percentage**
9. **Color Saturation**
10. **Red Dominance** (How much red dominates)

---

## 🔍 How It Works

The model uses a **threshold-based decision system**:

1. Extracts 10 RGB intensity features from the image
2. Compares each feature against learned thresholds
3. Calculates an **anemia score** (0-4):
   - Low red intensity → +1 point
   - High paleness → +1 point
   - Low redness ratio → +1 point
   - Weak red dominance → +0.5 points
4. **If score ≥ 2**: Predicts Anemia
5. **Otherwise**: Predicts Normal

---

## 💡 Key Advantages

✅ **Simple & Fast**: No complex ML algorithms  
✅ **Interpretable**: Shows exactly which RGB features indicate anemia  
✅ **Lightweight**: < 1 KB model size (just thresholds in JSON)  
✅ **Explainable**: Confidence factors show deviation percentages  
✅ **No Dependencies**: Only requires OpenCV and NumPy for inference

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

1. **Moderate Accuracy (52%)**: Due to subtle differences in dataset
2. **Sensitive to Lighting**: RGB values vary with lighting conditions
3. **Dataset Labels**: Original dataset had unlabeled images (assigned random labels)
4. **Simple Decision Logic**: May miss complex patterns that ML models can capture
