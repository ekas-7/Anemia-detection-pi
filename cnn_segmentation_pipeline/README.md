# CNN Segmentation Pipeline

This folder contains the deep-learning (CNN-based) segmentation pipeline components.

Structure:
- data/: Datasets (Eyes Defy, CP, Conjunctiva)
- preprocessing/: Image normalization and noise removal scripts
- segmentation/: U-Net / Mask R-CNN implementations and annotations
- models/: CNN architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet) and checkpoints
- training/: Training scripts and configuration files
- inference/: Model serving and inference scripts

Notes:
- Intended for cloud or high-performance GPU systems.
